# Key Considerations

### How will your app handle data persistence?

I will build a Content Provider and the service that load data from the server to the local database

### Describe any corner cases in the UX.

I didn't see any corner cases

### Describe any libraries youâ€™ll be using and share your reasoning for including them.

com.android.support:cardview-v7: add cardview

com.android.support:appcompat-v7: add actiona bar support
com.android.support:recyclerview :add recyclerview for data list
com.android.support:design: add fab and other feature from
com.squareup.picasso: caching places pic loaded from server
com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps: for maps
com.google.firebase: for the backend part
